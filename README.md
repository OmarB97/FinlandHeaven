# FinlandHeaven
A blockchain-based platform that enforces fair, transparent taxation using Ethereum. For HackDuke 2016: Code for Good. Winner of the ConsenSys Award for Best Use of Blockchain. Check out our Devpost here: https://devpost.com/software/finlandheaven.

# Inspiration
Many of the world problems can be solved by enforcing a transparent and efficient taxation system. Using Ethereum, we want to enable governments and organizations, especially nonprofits (such as the Community Empowerment Fund), to promote transparent, fair taxation with smart contracts.

# What it does
Using Ether cryptocurrency, we are creating an automated platform for income tax systems, ensuring financial transparency and efficiency, since governments of all levels and organizations (including nonprofits) do not file their own taxes.

With smart contracts, all taxes are transparent, since each user has a unique hash that contains their taxation level, and this hash is available to the government and relevant organizations.
